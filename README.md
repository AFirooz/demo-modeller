# Assignment III: Comparative Protein Structure Modeling Using MODELLER

## Objective & Challenge

Students will predict the 3D structure of a protein using comparative modeling, document the entire workflow, and evaluate their results. The aim is to familiarize students with comparative protein structure modeling tools, the concepts of target-template alignment, model evaluation, and understanding the implications of structural features in biological function.

**Note: All your coding process must be included in the result reports.**

  1- Prepare target sequence:
     Document all the pre-process steps.

     The target genomic sequence is as follow:

  2- Searching for structures:
     Using MODELLERâ€™s, search for related structures that can serve as templates. Select the best templates.
     Document the criteria for template selection, discussing why your chosen template(s) is appropriate.

  3- Model building, Evaluation and Validation
     Construct a 3D model of your target protein with the selected template.
     If several models are calculated, select five distinct models.
     Provide PDB files for each model and describe any observed structural differences among the generated models with the best model you are going to propose it.
     Document the criteria for selection & discussing why you are choosing them.

  4- Searching for existing models in the ModBase database and provid the Model Details report.

## Submission

- All files you are using during this assignment must be documented in a folder and submitted with final report.
- Provide detailed steps, scripts, and parameters used for each phase.
- Present the selected template(s), alignment, model structures, and DOPE scores in your results.
- Summarize your findings and mention your toughness during the procedures.
